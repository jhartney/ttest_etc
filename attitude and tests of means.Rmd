require(tidyverse)
```

## get attitude data


```{r }
tude <- attitude

```
## Take a look

```{r}

```{r}
t.test(tude$rating,tude$raises)
```
##Using bootstrp

```{r }
source("bootstrp.R")
result <- bootstrp(tude$raises,tude$rating,10000)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Which of the 7 different attitudes are similiar with respect to their means??
Rating and raises have the same mean of 64.63333, so these two are the most similar with respect to their means.
